# The Interplanetary Bar Tab: A Study in Fiscal Irresponsibility

In a moment of catastrophic optimism, I decided to throw a party. I invited everyone I knew—a demographic range that spanned from the socially respectable to people who likely aren’t allowed within five hundred yards of a courthouse. I hosted it at my old address. The current landlord, a man with the suspicious flexibility of a Third World border guard, let me have the place without much fuss. The apartment was pristine, save for the fact that the bathroom was currently a construction site of rubble and broken dreams.

When the guests arrived, the guest list looked like a collision between a Savile Row tailor’s convention and a daycare center. Half the room was draped in multi-layered, "fancy-lad" suits with enough accessories to trigger a metal detector from the street; the other half was children.

Once it became clear that the plumbing was a theoretical concept rather than a functioning reality, a friend suggested we move the festivities to his shop nearby. Everyone agreed with the kind of unearned enthusiasm usually reserved for tax cuts.

By this point, the gentlemen were several lagers deep, and the ladies were sipping summer cocktails that looked like liquid neon. Conversation had deteriorated into the kind of logic-free gibberish usually found in Lewis Carroll novels or Congressional hearings. But why let a minor thing like a coherent sentence get in the way of a good time?

We reached the shop only to find it was roughly five times too small for the mob. My friend then revealed the existence of a basement. Now, usually, when a man invites a crowd into his basement, you call the authorities. But, in the spirit of the evening, I ignored the impending sense of doom and followed the herd.

Access to the basement was via an ancient cage elevator designed for two people. We treated the capacity limit as a mere suggestion, cramming in until the motor began to smoke and the warning lights glowed with the intensity of a Soviet meltdown. We ignored the manual. Reading the manual is for people who aren't having fun, or Germans.

I watched the crowd vanish into the depths—including a few actual extraterrestrials. I don’t recall inviting Alpha Centauri’s finest, but there they were. I checked their IDs to ensure they were of legal drinking age; they produced documents that looked like something out of a Star Trek prop closet, but everything seemed to be in order. They even brought toys for the kids—fantastic, high-tech gadgets that made Lego look like sharpened sticks.

I tried to call my old supplier to check on the rations, but when he picked up, I could hear the party in the background. He was already in the basement. "The worst thing that could possibly happen," I told him, "is—" "—that we run out of booze," he interrupted, with the terrifying confidence of a man who knows his market.

He assured me he wasn’t an amateur. He had already organized a delivery of champagne, a troupe of scantily clad dancers, and several literal train-wagons of cocaine. My sense of impending disaster reached its zenith. My hair was standing on end, and not because of the fashion.

Then, a carriage arrived—the smallest vehicle I’ve ever seen. Out stepped a microscopic fairy who looked about eleven years old. She produced her ID before I could even ask. Her birthdate was a negative number. I gave her the idiotic smile of a man who has lost all grip on reality and ushered her in.

A dapper cat in a top hat followed her, looking down his nose at me like a French waiter. He was accompanied by two cats—one black, one white—who were entirely unencumbered by clothing. The tuxedoed cat explained they were part of the dance troupe. At this point, I simply stopped asking questions.

I had the distinct feeling I was presiding over a catastrophe of multi-planetary proportions. The party was in full swing. The "supplies" were being craned into the basement. I finally descended with my wife and adult sons. My wife was carrying a 451-story cake—a towering monument to gluten and ambition.

Downstairs, the cat was playing a metal set on an epic pipe organ that would have made Rick Wakeman weep. My youngest son was on drums, a fellow named Pavel Jeníkovský was on bass, and James Hetfield had somehow been recruited on guitar. The tiny fairy was singing, and she had the voice of Whitney Houston in her prime. It was magnificent. It was loud. It was probably illegal in forty-eight states.

The feline dance troupe performed a series of maneuvers that were as impressive as they were biologically confusing. A reporter from Variety was at the bar, shouting superlatives into her phone. We had a brief, testy exchange about GDPR and the fact that she wasn't on the guest list. She took offense and left in a huff.

Finally, the supplier handed me the bill. The figures on it were as bold and terrifying as the dancers' costumes. But, in for a penny, in for a trillion. I pulled out my phone and used the "Split Bill" feature on my Revolut app for the first time in my life.

A gazillion devices—phones, watches, and things that looked like glowing pebbles—chimed simultaneously. Everyone, including the aliens, hit "confirm." The sheer scale of the transaction caused interplanetary trade to collapse instantly. Markets crashed. Currencies vanished. But nobody cared.

Around midnight, my eldest son joined the fairy for a duet. It was so moving that even the most cynical drunks in the room went silent. When they finished, the applause was so violent it literally brought the ceiling down.

Since there was no time for minor details like "structural integrity," we didn't stop. We just called it an open-air festival and kept drinking.
