# The Strudel Manifesto: A Dispatch from the Edge of the Galaxy

I touched down in Brazil under the thin guise of "tweaking the power grid," but as usual, my professional life was quickly derailed by a domestic obsession. Within hours, I had pivoted from high-voltage engineering to a more urgent mission: dragging the local population kicking and screaming into the era of the **solid Apfel strudel**.

We didn’t stop at apples. We went rogue! I’m talking a "Gourmet Masochist" edition: vegetable strudel packed with meat and enough chili to make you see God. Side note: Brazilian cows are basically the *Ferraris* of the meat world. I dumped the recipes onto GitHub as public domain—giving the power back to the people—while [JIRA](https://ifuckinghatejira.com) rolled out new workflows to track our pastry-based progress.

## The Rise of the Pastry State

Then came the inevitable descent into the surreal. The Brazilian President appeared on **The Great Brazilian Bake Off**, wearing a chef’s hat and an apron, shamelessly harvesting political capital like a man who had never actually seen a rolling pin in his life.

Disgusted, I retreated to the Czech Republic, only to find the local oligarchs were suddenly solvent again. How? By selling reprints of my recipes. The irony was thick enough to choke a horse.

The political scene back home had coalesced around the usual suspects—those nostalgic vampires, the Communists. Their campaign slogan? "Back in the day, strudels were better because the State provided the apples." They swept the election with a mathematically impossible 300% of the vote. That evening, they staged a full-scale family execution for my benefit, forcing me to watch like it was a mandatory, horrific season finale of my own life.

Just as my heart was preparing to give out from the sheer weight of the melodrama, a **Proud Avenger** from Brazil arrived. He had a *lightsaber*. Don't ask me why; he just did. He rescued the whole clan before the trapdoors even opened.

We orchestrated a coup using a poisoned apple—very Snow White, very "Old World Tyranny." Remarkably, the whole regime toppled without a single casualty. Our little corner of the world was free, but I was done.

I realized then that my countrymen weren't interested in being competitive or learning English; they just wanted a "piece of bread," a steady stream of well-oiled propaganda, and the permission to pretend to be productive. So, I did what any rational man would do: I built a rocket in my backyard and flew as far away as physics would allow.

## Life on the Frontier

We now live on a planet where the soil is stubborn and the work is back-breaking. It’s perfect, because it’s too hard to be lazy here.

- **The Livestock**: We breed bizarre, hilarious animals for meat and milk.

- **The Booze**: My small distillery produces a nameless, high-octane *rocket fuel* from the local flora.

- **The Pastry**: We bake strudels out of things that shouldn't even be edible.

A former colleague eventually tracked us down. He brought a "portable" brewery and a can of Gentian Blue **RAL 5010** paint (because he’s a nerd). He built a high-speed rail network practically overnight. Why? Because there wasn't a single soul on the planet to bribe him into saying it was "impossible." We don't have highways. We don't need them.

My wife is currently busy teaching the locals **Yoga**. She’s convinced that flexible bodies with strong cores leads to sharp minds, firm breasts, and respectable backsides.

As for the kids? They’ve carved out their own paths. It was a brutal journey for them, but it made them formidable. I’m proud of them—though I try not to take any credit. After all, their stubbornness is entirely their own, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
