# Lady Doctor's Driver

I'm a doctor's driver. I feel like I know her well, but I'm not completely sure. I don't want to offend her, so I never ask when she calls me by nicknames I vaguely remember from my youth. At my age, I know it's best for the man to try to steer clear of awkward situations.

She's written extensively on transhumanism and is a very smart woman. I used to be smart, too. Well, at least I think so. I'm not sure what's going on, and I think it might be because I drank so much rum as a younger person. It's a miracle it didn't kill me, they all say. Anyway, my brain’s pretty pickled, so to speak.

The doctor has a challenging job and enjoys having fun in the evenings. She enjoys dancing, mostly. With people who are a bit younger and dressed a bit more revealingly. I always take her to the club and wait for her at the bar. If something goes wrong, I know about it. It's a decent place, though. Nothing ever goes wrong.

I usually get my drink at the bar to speed up the wait. I always order a "driver's drink," and the barmaid teases me for a bit before serving me a soda. The barmaids change, but there isn't a male bartender working at the club. They have a strict policy of only hiring female bartenders. I don't know them all, but each one of them calls me by name.

It’s a weird, foreign-sounding name, and it feels strange to hear it—like it belongs to someone else entirely. I’m getting used to it, but I can’t shake the feeling that I had another name that sounded a lot better. Maybe one day I’ll be able to remember, but I don't think so. Pickled brain, you know.

I'm watching the doctor on the dance floor. She reminds me of someone, but it must have been a long time ago. I leave the thought and I observe the dance. As they move in intricate patterns together, they look into each other's eyes, reading each other's stories — their triumphs, their regrets.

Occasionally a smile flickers across their faces or a wrinkle appears. I can tell which part they're in by that. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if someone could read my story and tell it back to me. Would I remember who I was then? Would it help me understand something? Would I even be able to bear it?

Now I'm taking the doctor and some of the girls to her place. It's Friday, and they're obviously still up for a good time. I'm enjoying the ride, taking a sharp turn here and there, watching them all enjoy this forgotten art. Some are experiencing it for the first time, holding on to each other, screaming with excitement.

Out of nowhere a doe materializes on the road. Within half a second, I make contact. But my rehearsed reaction is a lot quicker than that. I step hard on the brake, turn the steering wheel to the right, pull the handbrake, turn left and push full throttle. Time seems to stand still and the brutal negative G force puts all the ladies to sleep. They don't call this move the Spin-out for nothing.

I feel a massive surge of adrenaline, followed by serotonin and dopamine as we brush sideways against the paralysed doe like in a dance. The maneuver was executed flawlessly, not a single hair of that gorgeous fur ruffled. I see her knees buckle in the mirror while I pull back into the lane.

After pulling over to the side of the road, I turn on my blinkers and check on my well-buckled passengers, giving them a gentle slap. When they come back to themselves, I give a wink to the doctor, who, thanks to her training, hasn't fainted yet. She grabs my hand and I feel the tremor. I grimace to make her laugh and reach for my vest.

The doe is completely paralyzed. I take the doe in my arms, she trembles just like the doctor. As I put her down in the grass on the side of the road, I catch the sound of another car approaching quickly from the opposite direction. The autopilot would have slowed it down for sure, the machine's reactions are faster than mine, but the next one would have already run her over; she would be invisible to the AP's sensors.

I get lost in the stare for a moment, stroking the animal as it slowly and unsteadily gets to its feet and looks at me. I know it's completely stupid, there's nothing in that look. But this little moment is enough to make me miss the fact that the doctor has gotten out of the car and is walking towards us.

"Get in the car," I yell as I run toward her, trying to pull her to the side.

I notice the autopilot hasn't slowed down, hasn't even registered her yet.

"As smart as you are, the fool you are," I think.

I’m angry at her, but then the world narrows to a scream of tires as the autopilot of the oncoming car finally reacts. I close my eyes and lunge, but I’m too slow; my hands find only the empty space where she was. My momentum slams me hard into our car, my body hitting the very spot where she’d been standing a heartbeat earlier. An unforgettable mix of jarring sounds rushes through me, knocking me to the side.

When I get to my feet, fifty yards away, a passenger steps out. I walk in his direction and see her. Twisted limbs, face a mess. I jump to the doctor, lean in, feel her breath weakening.

"It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay," I hear myself lie.

"I'm sure it will," she whispers, coughing blood and trying to grin.

The next thing I remember is the sound of the rescue drone landing a few feet away, the professionals jumping out of it, and me being blinded by the flashes of the beacons reflecting off the shattered face. I see the closing eyes of the little girl who never listened when being told to wear a vest on the street…
