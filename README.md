# Short stories

Collection of short stories without a specific focus and/or timing. Most of them started as a dream during my last big vacation with the family in 2020 and when I woke up, I justed posted them to Twitter, which was real back then (more on the topic @ [characterlimit.net](https://www.characterlimit.net/ "Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter")).

A few years later, I decided to write them down in English and put somewhere I can find them later.

## The Stories list

### [Lady Doctor's Driver](Lady%20Doctor's%20Driver/index.md)

A poignant tale of a driver with a clouded memory who serves a brilliant doctor specializing in transhumanism. In a world of neon-lit clubs and high-tech rescue drones, he navigates the blurred lines between duty, memory, and the fragility of the lives he protects.
