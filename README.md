# Short stories

Collection of short stories without a specific focus and/or timing. Most of them started as a dream during my last big vacation with the family in 2020 and when I woke up, I justed posted them to Twitter, which was _IMO_ **much better platform** back then (more on the topic @ [characterlimit.net](https://www.characterlimit.net/ "Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter")).

A few years later, I decided to write them down in English and put somewhere I can find them later.

This was at least the plan, to put all the stories here.

Unfortunately, I was only able to find only a single story (pinned to my account), because everything else from that time is lost somewhere in [x.com](https://x.com) datacenters or silently deleted because I never paid for using the _[verified badge](https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/about-x-verified-accounts)_. Fortunately using Grok, I was able to retrieve at least some of them, so here we go:

## The Stories list

### [Lady Doctor's Driver](Lady%20Doctor's%20Driver/index.md)

A poignant tale of a driver with a clouded memory who serves a brilliant doctor specializing in transhumanism. In a world of neon-lit clubs and high-tech rescue drones, he navigates the blurred lines between duty, memory, and the fragility of the lives he protects.

### [The Interplanetary Bar Tab](Interplanetary%20Bar%20Tab/index.md)

A surreal narrative about organizing a party that spirals into chaos with friends, kids, aliens, talking animals, extravagant performances, and absurd escalations leading to an interstellar economic collapse and finally an open-air festival.

### [The Strudel Manifesto](The%20Strudel%20Manifesto/index.md)

A whimsical dream sequence starting with a trip to Brazil to teach strudel baking, evolving into political satire involving communists, revolutions, family life on a distant planet, and themes of productivity and legacy.
